 Chapter One
 Trevor Noah discusses his upbringing in South Africa during apartheid.
 He highlights the significance of religion in his family's life and the role of Christianity in his life. 
 This chapter also highlights the dangers and racial tensions of the apartheid era. 
 For example, the incident where the family's secondhand car fails to start,
 and they face potential harm while taking a minibus to church.
        
 Chapter Two        
 Trevor Noah explores the challenges of living in South Africa during apartheid,
 focusing on the fear and uncertainty faced by his mother and a mixed-race family.
 The chapter highlights the courage and resilience of his mother and others like her, 
 who faced the constant threat of being taken away for being coloured.
 Noah's birth was seen as a "crime" under apartheid laws,
 which made it illegal for men and women of different races to have a child together. 
 Trevor Noah was born to a white father so he was coloured and not able to interact more with other children while young.
        
 Connection with my county        
 I come from Nairobi County. We have estates for the rich called Westlands, then Eastlands, 
 and even slums for the middle and low-income earners.
 There are also areas which are more developed than others yet under the same leadership. 
 We have different churches as well, which are chosen not because of colour but because of where you prefer to go. 
 Even in Nairobi, we find these differences even in companies while job hunting like in the novel.
